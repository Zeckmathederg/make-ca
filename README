make-ca.sh is a script to deliver a complete PKI setup for linux workstaitons
using only bash, coreutils, and openssl, and optionally for OpenJDK, NSS, and
p11-kit if already installed, from the upstream Mozilla cacerts.txt. It was
developed for use with Linux From Scratch to minimize dependencies for early
system build, but has been written to be generic enough for any Linux
distribution.
